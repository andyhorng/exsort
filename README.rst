exsort
======

Introduction
------------

I found Python doesn't have a convenient module to sort huge list that is 
unable to fit in memory.
    

Installation
------------

exsort is distributed on `PyPI <https://pypi.org>`_ as a universal
wheel and is available on Linux/macOS and Windows and supports
Python 2.7/3.5+ and PyPy.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install exsort
